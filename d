The Supreme Court heard three emergency applications challenging the scope of federal courts' authority to issue universal 
injunctions (injunctions barring enforcement of an executive order against anyone, not just the plaintiffs). The Court held that 
universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority given to federal courts by Congress. The Court granted the applications
 for a partial stay of the injunctions, limiting them to providing complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue. 
 The Court's decision focused on the lack of historical precedent for universal injunctions in English courts of equity at the time 
 of the founding, rejecting arguments that they are analogous to bills of peace or modern class actions. The Court did not address the 
 merits of the underlying challenges to the executive order. Dissenting opinions argued that the majority's decision misinterprets equity
  principles, undermines the judiciary's role in enforcing the rule of law, and fails to adequately address the irreparable harm 
  that would result from allowing the executive order to take effect.\n"
